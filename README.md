# Personal-projects

Listed in the CodeCademy Projects are some of the basic projects I have done in different languages to practise the concepts.

I have made a recipt sorter to organise payment between me and my flatmates, as well as creating a speech to text transcriber.

There is also a private project that I am undertaking creating a text based story game in Python3
